# PELEAnalysis-Processing

This repository contains Python scripts to prepare the system for the PELE simulation and to analyze the generated data.

There are also other tools referring to assess the residue number of the catalytic residue in the catalytic triad,
the number of carbonyl carbon atoms in the ester bonds of some substrates and a tool to prepare a list of proteins
using prepwizard (coupled with propka).
